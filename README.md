Bouvet Microsoft-dag IIS sample
===============================

This is a sample project for a Bouvet hackaton 19. october. 

It demostrates getting data from one of the datasets in http://hotell.difi.no/. Data is fetched with a simple xhr call. The data is then displayed in a table using Knockout.js (http://knockoutjs.com/) and in a map using Google maps (https://developers.google.com/maps/)

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) is used for presentation and layout.

On Windows start server with `/Server/launch-windows`, navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view site
